## neural-re-experiments

A repository of experiments with various Transformer based Relation Extraction architectures.

The code here started off as an offshoot of my [tutorial on Transformer based Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) at ODSC East 2022](https://github.com/sujitpal/ner-re-with-transformers-odsc2022). In this repository I explore all six architectures referenced in the figure (reproduced below) from the paper [Matching the Blanks: Distributional Similarity for Relation Learning ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03158) by Soares et al (2019).
